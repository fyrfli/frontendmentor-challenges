# Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component exercies

In an attempt to practice my growing frontend development skills, I discovered the Frontend Mentor website and decided that even though I am still learning, I am going to attempt a challenge *right now*! I am having so much fun that I just couldn't wait. 

Tools I use: 

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- gitlab (this is a self-hosted installation and the project is mirrored on [Github](https://github.com/fyrfli/qr-code-component-challenge)


You can see this code in action on my [website](https://fyrfli.me/projects/qr-code-component-challenge/).
