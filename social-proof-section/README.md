## My process

My process was haphazard and scattered because failure usually demotiviates and allows distractions to intrude. But basically, I created my files, copied the originals to a hidden directory here, and started setting up my markup. Then I took each section individually and styled them. I started with the actual reviews and then got stuck on the ratings section and the svg image. This sort of caused me to dive down an svg rabbit hole for a few days. Then I went back to my booktcamp course before coming back to it. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- VSCode editor
- Self-hosted installation of Gitlab mirrored to Github.

### What I learned

I learned a few things:

- starting a challenge like this before I had covered the fundementals was a bad idea. So this challenge is taking a lot longer than I had hoped.
- I like box shadows **A LOT**.
- CSS is one helluva bear to manage and it will probably take me forever to get it right the first time but I will **NOT** give up.

Some code I am proud of:

```css
h1, h2, h3, h4 {
    margin: 0;
}
```

I learned along the way that the best way to space out headings is to zero the margins at the top of the style.css which gives some breathing room to see how things shape up later on.

### Continued development

I still need a LOT of CSS practice and I am almost a little afraid to get into javascript considering CSS is giving me such a challenge but I will get there eventually.
