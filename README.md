# Top level repository for frontendmentor.io challenges

Browsing on the dev.to community, I stumbled across a post in which it was suggested that depending on how many frontendmentor.io challenges one takes on, our github repositories could get pretty crowded. The suggestions was one big repository with a sub-folder for each challenge.

This is my frontendmentor.io challenge main repo. All my challenges will be maintained here.
