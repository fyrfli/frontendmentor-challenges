## My process

1. The first thing I did was download all the files and reorganise my directory so that I put the originals in a vault and created my outlines. Then I initialised the master branch of my repository and published it to my self-hosted gitlab.
2. Then I created a develop branch to server as my working branch.
3. Next, I created the HTML markup.
4. Then I started working on the mobile CSS styling using Firefox's Responsive Design Tool to check my work.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I feel like getting the profile image to move further down the card could have been achieved more professionally than a static padding:

```css
.profile-pic {
    margin: auto;
    padding-top: 80px;
}
```

```html
<div class="profile-pic">
    <img src="images/image-victor.jpg" alt="Victor's profile picture" />
</div>
```
---

I also had more trouble with the background images than I expected and looking at some other solutions, I am realising how much I don't know.

### Useful resources

- As always [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org) is a resource I depend heavily on.
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/), A newly discovered resource may not have been as useful this time around as it has in the past, but I did refer to it for some help.
