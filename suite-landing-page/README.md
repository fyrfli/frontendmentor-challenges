## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

As a tinkerer, I have been discovering tools I can use to do this work. I have had Panic's code editor [Nova](https://nova.panic.com) for a while and decided to see how to use it. In doing so, I discovered that the w3 validator does not like nesting a button tag within a link (a) tag. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24837102/the-element-button-must-not-appear-as-a-descendant-of-the-a-element) suggests nesting buttons in a form tag instead.

    To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

    ```html
    <h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
    ```
    ```css
    .proud-of-this-css {
      color: papayawhip;
    }
    ```
    ```js
    const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
      console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
    }
    ```

**I LOVE LEARNING!**
